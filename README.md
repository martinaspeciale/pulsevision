## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to estimate blood pressure categories (low, normal, high) starting from simple images of the wrist, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The approach is designed to explore the feasibility of **non-invasive blood pressure estimation** based on visual features.

The system was trained using a custom dataset collected with:
- **OMRON RS7 Intelli IT** wrist blood pressure monitor
- **Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor**

Data pre-processing and target discretization were performed using MATLAB scripts:
- `buildDataset.m`
- `discretizeTargets.m`

The deep learning model was implemented in **Python** with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

- `notebooks/bp_estimation_cnn.ipynb` â€” Main notebook implementing the models described in the thesis (Base Model and Regularized Model), training and evaluation.
- `scripts/` â€” MATLAB scripts used to build the dataset.
- `data/` â€” Data folder (structure to be created as expected by `image_dataset_from_directory`).
- `bachelor_thesis/bachelor_thesis.pdf` â€” Full thesis document (in Italian).
- `requirements.txt` â€” Required Python libraries.

## Main Techniques

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image-based classification
- **Data augmentation** and **dropout** for regularization
- **Early stopping** for optimal model selection
- **Confusion matrix** and **F1 score** as evaluation metrics

## Results

The models were evaluated on a testing set using standard metrics. The results and corresponding figures are reported in Chapter 5 of the thesis.
