## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to estimate blood pressure categories (low, normal, high) starting from simple images of the wrist, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The approach is designed to explore the feasibility of **non-invasive blood pressure estimation** based on visual features.

The system was trained using a custom dataset collected with:
- **OMRON RS7 Intelli IT** wrist blood pressure monitor
- **Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor**

Data pre-processing and target discretization were performed using MATLAB scripts:
- `buildDataset.m`
- `discretizeTargets.m`

The deep learning model was implemented in **Python** with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## Project Context

This project was developed in 2023 as part of my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Engineering at the University of Pisa, under the supervision of:

- Ing. F. Pistolesi (Relatore)
- Ing. M. Baldassini (Correlatore)

One of the main challenges of this work was dealing with a limited dataset.  
All images used in this project were manually acquired as part of the university project, with contributions from the thesis author, supervisors and other students, under controlled acquisition conditions and with the collaboration of volunteer participants.  
As a result, particular care was required in data preprocessing and model design to achieve good results despite the small amount of available data.

For more details on the dataset, experimental design, and results, please refer to the full thesis document (`bachelor_thesis/bachelor_thesis.pdf`).

```
- `notebooks/bp_estimation_cnn.ipynb` â€” Main notebook implementing the models described in the thesis (Base Model and Regularized Model), training and evaluation.
- `scripts/` â€” MATLAB scripts used to build the dataset.
- `data/` â€” Data folder (structure to be created as expected by `image_dataset_from_directory`).
- `bachelor_thesis/bachelor_thesis.pdf` â€” Full thesis document (in Italian).
- `requirements.txt` â€” Required Python libraries.

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository. The `data/` folder should contain the preprocessed image dataset, which can be generated by running the provided MATLAB scripts (`buildDataset.m` and `discretizeTargets.m`). See `data/README.md` for details.

## Main Techniques

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image-based classification
- **Data augmentation** and **dropout** for regularization
- **Early stopping** for optimal model selection
- **Confusion matrix** and **F1 score** as evaluation metrics

## Results

The models were evaluated on a testing set using standard metrics. The results and corresponding figures are reported in Chapter 5 of the thesis.
